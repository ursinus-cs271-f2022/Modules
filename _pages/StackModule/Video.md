<p>
Read section 6.2, 6.3, and 7.3 in the Sheehy book to review stacks, queues, and how both can be implemented with linked lists.  Make sure you can explain the following:
<Ul>
<li>A stack can be implemented with a linked list so that both push and pop are <b>O(1)</b></li>
<li>A queue has to be implemented with a doubly-linked list so that both enqueue (adding to the end of the line) and dequeue (removing from the front of the line) are both <b>O(1)</b>.  Please review ch. 8 if you need more practice with doubly-linked lists.  Luckily, all of these sections are only a couple of pages!</li>
</ul>
</p>

When you feel comfortable with all of this, move on to an exercise involving stacks and queues on the next page
