<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Arithmetic expressions in python work just as they do in in Java or C++.  So the +, -, /, and * operators do just what they did before.  The only new one is <code>a**b</code> which means raise <code>a</code> to the <code>b<SUP>th</SUP></code> power</li>
<li>Variables also are assigned with <code>=</code>, but types are not specified when defining them.  Instead, they are inferred at runtime.  For instance, any time two numbers are divided, the result is <b>always</b> cast as a <code>float</code></li>
<li>To see what type a variable currently is, write <code>type(variable)</code></li>
</ul>
