<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Inheritance in python works very similarly to how it does in Java with calling methods in the parent class and method overriding.</li>
<li>Because things are so loose in Java and parameter types aren't specified, we can create general purpose methods that operate on very different types of objects, as long as those objects share some properties.  We call this "duck typing," and it an alternative to inheritance</li>
<li>Static methods can be defined in classes.  They are accessed with the syntax <code>ClassName.variable_name</code></li>
</ul>
