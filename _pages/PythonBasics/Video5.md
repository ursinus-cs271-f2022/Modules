<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Every instance method of a class must take <code>self</code> as its first parameter.  <code>self</code> is akin to <code>this</code> in Java or C++.  Then, when referring to instance methods <b>and</b> instance variables, you must always do so with <code>self.</code></li>
<li>The constructor in a class is defined as <code>__init__(self, ...)</code></li>
<li>A "to string" method can be defined with <code>__str__(self)</code></li>
<li>There are no private or protected variables; everything is public.  The convention is that variables that start with an underscore are private variables</li>
<li>It is possible to add variables on the fly to python objects!  We do not need to declare them up front</li>
<li>Python objects are passed by reference, not by value!  So <code>obj1 = obj2</code> <b>does not</b> create a copy of <code>obj1</code>, but just makes <code>obj2</code> point to the same object as <code>obj1</code> in memory.  In this way, the variables that you use to refer to objects are really all pointers by default. </li>
</ul>
